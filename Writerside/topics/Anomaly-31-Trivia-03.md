Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption  

a) Symmetric encryption uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses the same key for both processes.

b) Symmetric encryption is faster than asymmetric encryption, while asymmetric encryption offers better security.

c) Symmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses only one key for both processes.

**d) Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.**
